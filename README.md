<hr/>

**Note:** this is very simple extension right now. I've decided to publish it because I haven't found anything like that for VS Code, so having poor support is better than nothing.
<hr/>

## Missing features

- [ ] no hover support, right now, VS Code presents hover like this:
![Bad Hover Support](res/img/hover-bad.png)

- [ ] snippets
- [ ] maybe better colors?
